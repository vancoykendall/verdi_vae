    "\n",
    "In addition to replicating the aforementioned papers, we also propose and investigate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Axis Alignment Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative inspections are unsuitable to compare models reliably due to their subjective and time consuming nature. Recent papers use quantitative measures of disentanglement based on the ground truth factors of variation **v** and the latent dimensions **z**. The [Mutual Information Gap (MIG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04942) metric is an appealing information theoretic metric which is appealing as it does not use any classifier. To get a MIG of 1 in the dSprites case where we have 10 latent dimensions and 5 generative factors, 5 of the latent dimensions should exactly encode the true factors of variations, and the rest should be independent of these 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a metric like MIG is what we would like to use in the long term, current models do not get good scores and it is hard to understand what they should improve. We thus propose an axis alignment metric AAM, which does not focus on how much information of **v** is encoded by **z**, but rather if each v<sub>k</sub> is only encoded in a single z<sub>j</sub>. For example in the dSprites dataset, it is possible to get an AAM of 1 if **z** encodes only 90% of the variance in the x position of the shapes as long as this 90% is only encoded by a single latent dimension z<sub>j</sub>. This is a useful metric to have a better understanding of what each model is good and bad at. Formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Axis Alignment Metric](doc/imgs/aam.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the subscript *(d)* denotes the *d*<sup>th</sup> order statistic and *I*<sub>x</sub> is estimated using empirical distributions and stratified sampling (like with MIG):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Mutual Information for AAM](doc/imgs/aam_helper.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Model Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is decoupled from all the losses and it should thus be very easy to modify the encoder / decoder without modifying the losses. We only used a single model in order to have more objective comparisons of the different losses. The model used is the one from [Understanding disentangling in β-VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03599), which is summarized below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Model Architecture](doc/imgs/architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Losses Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "All the previous losses are special cases of the following loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Loss Overview](doc/imgs/loss.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Index-code mutual information**: the mutual information between the latent variables **z** and the data variable **x**. There is contention in the literature regarding the correct way to treat this term. From the [information bottleneck perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01350) this should be penalized. [InfoGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03657) get good results by increasing the mutual information (negative α). Finally, [Wasserstein Auto-Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01558) drops this term. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Total Correlation (TC)**: the KL divergence between the joint and the product of the marginals of the latent variable. *I.e.** a measure of dependence between the latent dimensions. Increasing β forces the model to find statistically independent factors of variation in the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dimension-wise KL divergence**: the KL divergence between each dimension of the marginal posterior and the prior. This term ensures the learning of a compact space close to the prior which enables sampling of novel examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The losses differ in their estimates of each of these terms and the hyperparameters they use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**Standard VAE Loss**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114): α=β=ɣ=1. Each term is computed exactly by a closed form solution (KL between the prior and the posterior). Tightest lower bound.\n",
    "* [**β-VAE<sub>H</sub>**](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy2fzU9gl): α=β=ɣ>1. Each term is computed exactly by a closed form solution. Simply adds a hyper-parameter (β in the paper) before the KL.\n",
    "* [**β-VAE<sub>B</sub>**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03599): α=β=ɣ>1. Same as **β-VAE<sub>H</sub>** but only penalizes the 3 terms once they deviate from a capacity C which increases during training.\n",
    "* [**FactorVAE**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05983): α=ɣ=1, β>1. Each term is computed exactly by a closed form solution. Simply adds a hyper-parameter (β in the paper) before the KL. Adds a weighted Total Correlation term to the standard VAE loss. The total correlation is estimated using a classifier and the density-ratio trick. Note that ɣ in their paper corresponds to β+1 in our framework.\n",
    "* [**β-TCVAE**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04942): α=ɣ=1 (although can be modified), β>1. Conceptually equivalent to FactorVAE, but each term is estimated separately using minibatch stratified sampling."
